<h1>Born a crime</h1>
<h2>The religion</h2>
<img src="NJ Images/image.jpg">

<p>Trevor and his mother they were christians, they could go for three services on Sunday from different churchs.
	<ul><li>Rhema Bible Church</li>
	    <li>Methodist Church</li>
	    <li>Rosebank Union</li>
</ul>Church played a large role in Trevor Noah's upbringing because his mother is a very religious woman who never misses church. Noah was at church more evenings than he wasn't as a child or in praying ground.</p>

<p>Noah’s mother was very religious person like many indigenous people forced into Christianity.They belived that Jesus promises to save them from the same people who impose him on them and call their traditional beliefs"primitive" first belief.
The white man was quite stern with the native. “You need to pray to Jesus,” he said. “Jesus will save you.” To which the native replied, “Well, we do need to be saved—saved from you, but that's beside the point. So let’s give this Jesus thing a shot.”</p>

<p>In Soweto the area which they were living religion filled the void left by absent men.They were no men who could join the praying ground for they were less, but for the women on the area (Soweto) old and young they could attend the prayer meetings.They were prayerful and they could sing at the same and having testimonies.</p>

<p>The community people they were believers for they had faith and love which they showed to one another. This is like when Trevor pee on the newspaper in the house, his faith was fighting him for he was sinning against Holy Spirit.He could say to himself "I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility". So no one have never shit even "pope" the high priest he does.
In the community they shows love like when they came to Trevor's home to cast for the demon which they thought was.They casted the demon they believed it was no more.This means they cared for each other.</p>
<p>Trevor's dad was loving and devoted but he would only see him when permitted. Her mother used to love him and she could tell him 
"I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return." Her grand also loved him for the extent that she could not pinch or even whip him for the reason he was unique to be white boy.

<p>The differences among the three churches also reveal differences among the three groups in question. The mixed-race congregation shows the possibility of different races celebrating together, bound by a common belief. The white church shows the centrality of education in the white culture that enjoys the privilege to access it, which also points to how surprising it is for Trevor to out-Bible quiz the more advantaged white kids at the church. In contrast, the black church shows how suffering and poverty are defining features of blacks’ experiences under apartheid. Africans also clearly interpret Christianity in a distinctive way, including how Trevor’s mother considers blessings and prayers something of a tit-for-tat transaction.</p>

<h3>Poverty</h3>
<p>
For the million people who lived in Soweto, there were no stores, no bars, no restaurants. There were no paved roads, minimal electricity, inadequate sewerage. But when you put one million people together in one place, they find a way to make a life for themselves. A black-market economy rose up, with every type of business being run out of someone's house: auto mechanics, day cafe, guys selling refurbished tires. The people would build a kiosk in there areas,buy wholesale bread and eggs,and then resell them piecemeal this is because nobody had any money.
</p>
<p>. Soweto people they were building on their lands but it took much time for they were saving little at a time. They had only two rooms for the whole family for living. Sadly thing with the Soweto living they never aspire to improve your toilet or indoor running water. They were sharing toilet and water tap.
Many of the black people they were working for low level work like in farm, factory or in a mine while white they were working for white-collar jobs.
